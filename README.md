# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is configured for GitHub Pages. To deploy:

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select the `main` branch
   - Click "Save"

3. **Your site will be live at:**
   - `https://spiritconnectsciandtec.github.io/`

Since your repository is named `spiritconnectsciandtec.github.io`, GitHub Pages will automatically serve your site from the root directory. The `.nojekyll` file ensures that GitHub Pages serves your files directly without Jekyll processing.

**Note:** It may take a few minutes for the site to be available after enabling GitHub Pages.
