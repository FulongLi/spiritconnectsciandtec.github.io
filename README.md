## 🚀 What We Do

Spirit Connect – Power Labs builds **automation tools and workflows** that help engineers design high-performance power converters faster and with better trade-offs.

- **AI-driven topology exploration** – LLC, DAB, multi-level, interleaved buck/boost, and more  
- **Magnetics and semiconductor selection** – WBG devices, core sizing, and winding optimization  
- **Loss & thermal modeling** – efficiency maps, safe operating areas, temperature predictions  
- **Control synthesis** – current/voltage loops, soft-switching zones, phase-shift and TPWM  
- **Multi-objective optimization** – efficiency vs. density vs. cost vs. EMI headroom  
- **Validation planning** – HIL/SIL hooks, automated test scripts, and repeatable experiments
