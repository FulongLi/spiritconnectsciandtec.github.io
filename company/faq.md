        <h3>Is consciousness transfer safe?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The Cabin SC1 uses non-invasive neural interface technology. The process is completely safe and painless, 
        with no surgical procedures required. Your physical body remains unharmed throughout the process.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card">
        <h3>How long does the transfer process take?</h3>
        <p>The initial consciousness transfer typically takes 24-48 hours. The duration depends on the complexity and 
        volume of your memories and consciousness data. Continuous updates happen in real-time after the initial transfer.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Can I still live my normal life after transfer?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. The Cabin SC1 operates in the background, continuously updating your digital consciousness while 
        you continue living your normal physical life. Both your physical and digital selves can coexist.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>What happens to my digital consciousness?</h3>
        <p>Your digitized consciousness is stored securely and can exist in virtual environments like Another World. 
        You can interact with it, update it, and it will continue to exist even after your physical body is gone.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you sign NDAs?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We routinely work under NDA and respect all privacy and confidentiality requirements for consciousness data.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Where is my consciousness data stored?</h3>
        <p>Your digitized consciousness is stored in encrypted, secure servers with multiple redundancy systems. 
        We use military-grade encryption (AES-256) to protect your data.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Can I access Another World without Cabin SC1?</h3>
        <p>No. You must first upload your consciousness using the Cabin SC1 system before you can enter Another World. 
        The Cabin SC1 is essential for the consciousness transfer process.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is the 3D Projector required?</h3>
        <p>The 3D Projector is optional but recommended for optimal visualization of your digitized consciousness. 
        It provides stunning holographic displays and real-time interaction capabilities.</p>
